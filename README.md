Whenever you're feeling lonely or depressed, focus on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com).



### Here's Some Flags of Mine

- Try to use C or C++ language to finish the problems.
- Try to keep this repository updated.
- Try not to see the answer before I finishe it myself.
- Try to get the most optimal solution.
- Try to work on the problems in ascending order.



### What if I Cannot Keep my Flag

Open an issue and post some [Azis's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azis) sexy pics.



### What Else You Need to Know

- DO NOT give me pull request, I want to work on the problems myself.
- DO NOT expect me to add enough comment or describe the algorithm.
- DO NOT try to run the programs directly, they are just my submission, there's no `main` function.
- DO NOT post porn pics in the issue page. If you do, I will collect the pics and delete your issue.
