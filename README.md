Whenever you're feeling lonely or depressed, focus on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com).



## Here's Some Flags of Mine

- Try to use C or C++ to finish the problems.
- Try to keep this repository updated.
- Try not to see the answer before I finish it myself.
- Try to get the most optimal solution.



## Format Rules

- The content of file should be ready for submission, that is, directly copy & paste everything in the file to the corresponding problem should pass all test cases.
- The file name should start with the problem index, followed by the lowered cased problem full name, the words and numbers are joined with `_`.



## What Else You Need to Know

- DO NOT give me pull request, I want to work on the problems myself.
- DO NOT expect me to add enough comment or describe the algorithm.
- DO NOT try to run the programs directly, they are just my submission.
